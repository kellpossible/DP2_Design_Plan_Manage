Tutorial for SPPM - 20/04/2016
-------------------------------

- Done , use iso standard 9126.

------------------------------

Project backlog - Sprint 2
-----------------------------------

- API for simulation of barcode scanning?
- Add imcompleted items from sprint 1. 
- Use json to transfer DATA.
- new table, each time item gets sold, item ID and date it was bought, quantity, transaction table. amount in dollars sold.
- login page should be part of backlog.


9126

Functionality
--------------
	- Suitability. 
	  As long as the functionality does what it is supposed to do then it is suitable. 
	- Accuracy, 
	  Should be accurate, simple tasks are performed and done, no chance to make error.
	- Compliance, front end stuff should pass web standards for html (can run test.)
	- Security - Login, users can't access without loging in.


Reliability
---------------
	- Maturity
	  Should only fail once a month
	- fault tollerance
	  database fault tollerance, database is robust. 
	  If crashes, redirect to error page. 
	- Recoverability
	  Should be able to automatically recover. 

Usability 
---------------
	- Understandability
	- Learnability
	  User Manual, Half an hour learning time. 
	- Operability
	  Tablet, in a pharmacy.


Efficiency
--------------------
	- Time Behaviour
	  1 second for operations. 

	- Resource behaviour
	  Should be able to run on a average computer/laptop without draining resources noticebly.


Maintainability
-------------------
	- Adaptability
      Ability to print out stack traces and give user error. 
    - Changability
    - Stability
      negative impact of changes should be restricted to modules (controllers)
    - Testability
      Unit testing framework. (%80 code coverage) should be (%100 right.).

Portability
---------------------
	- Adaptability
	  Adaption to different screen sizes, different web-browsers. Chrome, Firefox, IE 9.0
	- Installability

	- Conformance
	  SQL lite database, most languages support SQLite. 
	- Replaceability
