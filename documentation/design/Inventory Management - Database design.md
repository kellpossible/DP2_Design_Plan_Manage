Inventory management table
---------------------------



**Desgin

	Product inventory Table.
	------------------------------
	- Product ID. (primary Key) ? 
	- Product name.
	- Product cost price.
	- Product sale price.
	- Product stock level. 
	- Product descriptions. 

**Notes

	- I think at this stage we won't be needing seperate tables for stock levels
	  Although i did some research and i've seen some databases use stock levels in a seperate table.
	- If there is anything i have missed out or you guys think needs removal, let me know.
